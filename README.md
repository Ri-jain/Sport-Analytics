# Sport-Analytics


I‚Äôve been a avid tennis fan for some year now, and this season I‚Äôve followed it more closely than ever. As a fan, I wanted to channel that excitement into something meaningful, so I built this project as a way to merge my love for tennis with analytics.

Using six years of ATP data (2019‚Äì2024), I simulated the 2025 US Open. But instead of only relying on raw stats, I layered in some logical assumptions to make the analysis feel closer to reality , for example, that older players may have lower recovery rates and stamina compared to younger players, or that past performance on a specific surface should matter in predicting future outcomes.

Combining those assumptions with the data, I calculated features like mental toughness, physical conditioning, and adaptability, then ran predictive models and 10,000 tournament simulations. The results consistently showed Djokovic, Sinner, and of course Alcaraz as the strongest contenders.

I know it has its limitations ‚Äî it only accounts for results up to 2024 and not the current season ‚Äî but that was part of the fun. This wasn‚Äôt about being ‚Äúperfectly accurate.‚Äù It was about experimenting, learning, and finding joy in using data to tell stories about a sport I love. 



# üéæ ATP Tennis Match Prediction & US Open 2025 Forecast

##  Project Objective  
This project leverages six years of ATP men‚Äôs tennis match data (2019‚Äì2024) to predict potential winners of the 2025 US Open. By integrating advanced feature engineering (Elo ratings, mental toughness, fitness scores) with predictive modeling and tournament simulations, the project uncovers key performance drivers behind Grand Slam success.

##  Business Questions Addressed  
- **Tournament Forecasting:** Who are the most likely champions for the 2025 US Open?  
- **Performance Drivers:** Do serve %, break-point conversion, and stamina correlate with higher win probability?  
- **Player Momentum:** How do Elo rating trends reflect form, consistency, and volatility?  
- **Match Conditions:** Do scheduling and weather adaptability significantly impact outcomes?  
- **Stamina vs. Mental Toughness:** How do younger players compare to veterans in pressure scenarios?  

---

## Data Sources  
- **ATP Match Data (2019‚Äì2024)** covering:  
  - Player names, rankings, and outcomes  
  - Serve/return statistics, break-point conversion, match durations  
  - Surface information (hard, clay, grass)  
  - Championship progression records  

---

##  Key Tasks Performed  
- Cleaned and standardized six years of ATP match data across multiple datasets  
- Engineered advanced features: **Elo ratings, mental toughness, stamina curves, weather adaptability, scheduling advantage**  
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest) with **~87% accuracy** in predicting match outcomes  
- Ran **10,000 Monte Carlo tournament simulations** to project US Open 2025 outcomes  
- Designed **visual dashboards** showing probability heatmaps, player progression, and round-by-round advancement  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Djokovic** showed unmatched consistency in Elo stability and adaptability across conditions  
- **Sinner** displayed the sharpest Elo climb, with strong momentum in 2024 form trends  
- **Alcaraz** led in physical conditioning and long-match stamina, reinforcing his next-gen contender status  
- Younger players excelled in **fitness metrics**, while veterans dominated in **mental toughness & pressure performance**  
- Simulations consistently highlighted **Djokovic, Sinner, and Alcaraz** as top contenders, with **Sinner** emerging as the projected **2025 US Open Champion**
